## Sentiment Prediction on IMDB Reviews
This Project uses a Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the sentiment of IMDB reviews. It's a simple project to understand the embedding layer and how RNNs work with sequential data like sentences. The dataset, sourced from Keras, consists of 25,000 training sequences and 25,000 testing sequences. The target column has binary values: positive or negative. RNNs are used because they are effective for sequential data.

### Further Development
This prediction model can be improved by using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).
